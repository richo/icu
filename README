= ICU -- International Components for Unicode for Ruby



== Download

The latest version of ICU can be found at

* http://rubyforge.org/

== Installation

The prefered method of installing ICU is through its GEM file. You'll need to have
RubyGems[http://rubygems.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl] installed for that, though. If you have,
then use:
